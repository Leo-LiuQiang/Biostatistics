# Biostatistics
Hi everyone! I'm an undergraduate student from NJU, and I'm planning to apply to a graduate school for Biostatistical study.
This folder includes files that I've used in my past courses or projects. 
Through these practices, I improved my skills in biostatistical methods and analysis.
Hope this folder helps you get to know me.
Enjoy your review!
